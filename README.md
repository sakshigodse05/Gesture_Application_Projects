# Computer Vision Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains a set of Python-based Computer Vision mini projects developed using **OpenCV**, **Haar Cascades**, and basic ML/DL techniques.  
Each script performs a specific real-time detection or interactive functionality using webcam input.

## 🚀 Projects Included
- **drowsiness.py** – Detects eye closure and drowsiness using facial landmarks.
- **face_detection.py** – Real-time face detection using Haar Cascades.
- **face_eye.py** – Detects both face and eyes simultaneously.
- **full_upper_body.py** – Detects upper-body region from live camera feed.
- **hand_gesture.py** – Simple hand gesture detection module.
- **heart.py** – Heart-shape pattern recognition demo.
- **image.py** – Basic image processing (filters, shapes, etc.).
- **snake.py** – OpenCV-based snake game.
- **zoom_control.py** – Controls screen zoom using hand gestures.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Haarcascade Classifiers  
- Webcam Stream Processing  

## 📌 How to Run
```bash
pip install opencv-python
python filename.py

📷 Requirements
Python 3.x
Webcam-enabled device
OpenCV installed

🧠 Purpose of This Repository
These scripts were created to practice Computer Vision fundamentals, real-time detection, and to build intuition for larger AI/ML projects.
